Sudoku Checker Task
  This Kotlin program validates Sudoku boards of different sizes (e.g., 9x9, 4x4) by checking for correctness based on Sudoku rules. The validator ensures that:
  
  - Each row contains unique numbers.
  - Each column contains unique numbers.
  - Each subgrid contains unique numbers.
  - The board size is a perfect square (e.g., 4x4, 9x9, 16x16).
  - The board contains only valid numbers within its range.


Ipv4 Task
    This Kotlin program validates IPv4 addresses by ensuring they conform to standard IPv4 formatting rules. The validator checks:
    
    - The presence of exactly three dots (.) separating four numerical segments.
    - Each segment contains only numeric characters.
    - Each segment is within the valid range (0-255).
    - No segment has leading zeros unless it is a single-digit 0.
